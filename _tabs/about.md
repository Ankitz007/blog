I never thought my dream was to be a Software Engineer. During my school days, I tried myself with sports, science, (chess) and what not. But I kind of just felt meh. I yearned to learn more, yearned to learn something different. Then I joined college.

And that's when it happened; the spark I was missing ignited the instant I clicked play on my first `Python tutorial` video (`The New Boston`, if I remember correctly). Since then, I can't get enough. Software development calls to all my passions; it incorporates creativity and problem solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

I like to `automate things` and find solution for `real life problems using code`. I'm highly fascinated by FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) and want to contribute to Open Source Community. When it comes to Web Development, I love applying responsive design principles and watching the web pages shrink into mobile screens and still look amazing. I am fascinated by the way back-end interacts with front-end in approximately no time and provides beautiful interactions to the clients.

_This is how my den looks like. Well, not exactly, but you get the idea, right? ðŸ˜‚_

I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto any other things, tools, or principles I can integrate into the coding web in my head. Iâ€™m also eager to meet other software engineers in the area, so feel free to connect!
